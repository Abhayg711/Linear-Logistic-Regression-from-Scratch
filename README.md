# Linear-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch

Linear Regression - The linear regression technique involves the continuous dependent variable and the independent variables can be continuous or discrete. By using best fit straight line linear regression sets up a relationship between dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).

Logistic Regression - The logistic regression technique involves dependent variable which can be represented in the binary (0 or 1, true or false, yes or no) values, means that the outcome could only be in either one form of two.

In this workbook I have tried to implement linear & logistic regression from scratch i.e. tried to implement both these algorithms without using any puython libraries instead I have tried to write cost functions & gradient descent function for both linear & logistic regression.
